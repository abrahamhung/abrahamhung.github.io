<h1> Making fun of the netart archive page </h1>
<main>
	<h3> Scaling differences changing effective width of the display medium</h3>
	<p>Two displays were used, both at 1920x1080. The difference is that one has the size of apps and text on the main display scaled to 100%, and the other to 125%. These are the default values for a desktop and a laptop computer. This translates to a large screen and a small screen (medium?)
	The most immediately obvious difference is that the display with larger text obviously could not fit as many items as the small display.
	</p>
	<p>These images were captured on two different machines that have different physical dimensions. A similar effect could technically be produced by simply scaling the browser window, but would result in lower resolution screenshots.</p>
	
	<h3>Text size</h3>
	<p>On the small screen, the text appears with approximately similar physical size, but is scaled up 125% relative to the size of the screen. The text stretches across the entire page with much less margin. Despite having less side margin, there are still more lines indicating that the margins were not enough to compensate for reduced screen width.</p>
	<div class="gallery">

	<img src="netart/netart sml top.png" alt="but the image is missing!?">
	</div>
	
	<h3>Overlap</h3>
	<p>Due to having much smaller margin on the text, the net art anthology header at the top left occludes text on the smaller display. Box items later appear over the header item though.</p>
	<div class="gallery">
	<img src="netart/netart med tr1.png" alt="but the image is missing!?">
	<img src="netart/netart sml tr1.png" alt="but the image is missing!?">
	</div>
	
	<h3>Gallery width</h3>
	<p>The smaller screen was only able to fit two items per row in it's display galleries, compared to three items per row in the larger screen. This goes down to one with a narrower display, and presumably would continue scaling up with a wider display.</p>
	<div class="gallery">
	<img src="netart/netart med tr2.png" alt="but the image is missing!?">
	<img src="netart/netart sml tr2.png" alt="but the image is missing!?">
	</div>
	
	<h3>Awkward last item</h3>
	<p>There were an odd number of items in this display, and a tall item second to last. When displaying on a n by 2 grid, this results in a hanging box that's separated from it's upper neighbor.</p>
	<div class="gallery">
	<img src="netart/netart med tr3.png" alt="but the image is missing!?">
	<img src="netart/netart sml tr3.png" alt="but the image is missing!?">
	</div>
	
	<h3>Edge justification</h3>
	<p>On the larger screen, there is enough space between the centered display and the edge of the screen that an edge-justified box fits within that margin.</p> 
	<div class="gallery">
	<img src="netart/netart med jst.png" alt="but the image is missing!?">
	<img src="netart/netart sml jst.png" alt="but the image is missing!?">
	</div>
	
	<h3>End of document</h3>
	<p>The gallery at the end also had a different number of suggested works per row.</p>
	<div class="gallery">
	<img src="netart/netart med end.png" alt="but the image is missing!?">
	<img src="netart/netart sml end.png" alt="but the image is missing!?">
	</div>
	
	<h3>Proposed solution</h3>
	<p>So I've mostly just been making fun of how the grid alignment looks funky when scaled to a different size. The simplest solution in this case would be to center the gallery, so that things don't appear off to the side.</p>
	
	<h1>The actual website</h1>
	<p>A simple database website that tracked submissions. Nothing much to see here. The site hasn't been updated since the early 2000s.</p>
