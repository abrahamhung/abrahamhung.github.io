    <h1>Wordle but worse in many ways</h1>

    <p>The proposal is to implement a working version of the wordle game framework as a web application.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a> is a game written by an independent developer and recently purchased by NY Times. The basic premise is a simple information game where the player makes a limited number of guesses about what a word will be. An indication on the correctness of their guess is provided to improve further guesses. </p>

    <h1>wireframe</h1>
    <p>restart button
    Text input
    guess list / correctness
    </p>

    <h1>Tools</h1>
    <p> Jquery, with most of game logic implementation in js.
        similar to pong but maybe better.
    </p>

    <h1>design strategy</h1>
    <p>Bare html is a good theme</p>

    <h1>Bottom Text</h1>
