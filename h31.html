			<h3> As We May Think </h3>
			<p>
				On the topic of improving access to information through the use of technology, a great deal of information is accessed as needed. This data compiled from the web of disparate sources by the search engine giant of Google. These far-flung fragments of knowledge are often gathered in the crowd-sourced research of Wikipedia, the largest repository of compiled knowledge the world has yet borne witness to.

			<h3> Long Live the Web </h3>
			<p>
				Net neutrality and the the right to freely access the entirety of the web from any location is a fundamental principle of allowing the web to truly enhance human communication. Technology has become an extension to many people's social presence. With the advent of a pandemic, people rely on the web now more than ever before to remain connected. Geopolitical borders broadly limit the possible communication of any common person, and a neutral web resists the attempts of political entities to control information.
